#JavaScript30 - Project 10: Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes

## Exercise
This lesson was a challenge to try ourselves. My solution is the file index.html in this repository.

The user must be able to click on a check box and then holding down the shift key, click any other checkbox. All checkboxes in between should be selected also.
